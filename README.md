# Kaggle-WorldDevelopmentIndicators

## Introduction

An exploration of various country development indicators. The World Development Indicators from the World Bank contain over a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world. In particular, I chose to focus on the relationship between the economic growth and development, and educational quality of various countries. 

## Workflow

Utilised SQL to query and extract information from the underlying data set (sourced from Kaggle) and communicated findings through data visualisations created with plotting packages such as matplotlib, seaborn and plotly in Python.
