# Kaggle-WorldDevelopmentIndicators

## Introduction

An exploration of various country development indicators. The World Development Indicators from the World Bank contain over a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world. In particular, I chose to focus on the relationship between the economic growth and development, and educational quality of various countries. 

## Workflow

To conduct this analysis, I familiarised myself with SQL as it involved working with data in a large database, and utilised various plotting packages to communicate my findings. 

The underlying data set is sourced from Kaggle.
